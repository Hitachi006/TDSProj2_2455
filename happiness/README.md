# Analysis Summary for _happiness.csv_

### 1. Describe the Data

The dataset consists of **2,363 samples** across **11 variables**. The variables include:

- **Country name** (categorical)
- **year** (numerical, int64)
- **Life Ladder** (numerical, float64)
- **Log GDP per capita** (numerical, float64)
- **Social support** (numerical, float64)
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (numerical, float64)
- **Freedom to make life choices** (numerical, float64)
- **Generosity** (numerical, float64)
- **Perceptions of corruption** (numerical, float64)
- **Positive affect** (numerical, float64)
- **Negative affect** (numerical, float64)

The data types are a mix of categorical and numerical types. Some missing data related to numerical variables is observed, specifically with the following counts of missing entries: 
- Log GDP per capita: 28
- Social support: 13
- Healthy life expectancy: 63
- Freedom to make life choices: 36
- Generosity: 81
- Perceptions of corruption: 125
- Positive affect: 24
- Negative affect: 16

### 2. Explain the Analysis Carried Out

The analysis primarily involved examining the relationships between different variables within the dataset. A correlation matrix was generated to quantify the strength of these relationships using the Pearson correlation coefficient. High correlations were particularly observed between:

- **Life Ladder** and **Log GDP per capita** (0.78)
- **Life Ladder** and **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (0.71)
- **Log GDP per capita** and **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (0.82) - this being the maximum observed correlation in the dataset.

This suggests that countries with higher GDP also tend to have higher life satisfaction and better health outcomes. Other variables such as **Social support**, **Freedom to make life choices**, and various affect measures were included to further analyze patterns related to well-being.

### 3. Key Insights from the Analysis

- The strongest correlation is observed between **Log GDP per capita** and **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (0.82). This indicates that economic prosperity is closely linked to better health outcomes.
- **Life Ladder**, a measure of life satisfaction, shows significant positive correlations with both **Log GDP per capita** (0.78) and **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (0.71).
- **Perceptions of corruption** have notable negative correlations with **Life Ladder** (-0.43), indicating that higher levels of corruption perceived may decrease life satisfaction.
- **Negative affect** is positively correlated with **year** (0.21), suggesting that over the years, negative feelings may have become more pronounced in certain contexts, possibly due to socioeconomic changes.

### 4. Recommend Potential Implications of the Insights

- **Policy Focus on Economic Performance**: Governments may want to prioritize economic policies that bolster GDP growth as a means to enhance overall public health and life satisfaction.
- **Healthcare Investments**: Investments in healthcare services that enhance life expectancy could yield improvements in national happiness metrics.
- **Corruption Reduction Strategies**: Implementing measures to tackle corruption could improve public perceptions, thereby potentially boosting life satisfaction.
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Longitudinal studies tracking mental health and well-being concerning economic variables could provide deeper insights into causal relationships and trends over time.
- **Social Support Structures**: Given correlations with life satisfaction, bolstering social support systems can be a pathway for enhancing overall happiness and well-being in populations.

These insights lead to actionable strategies for policymakers aiming to improve quality of life and societal health outcomes.
